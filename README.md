EC2 : Amazon EC2 is a cloud computing service that allows users to launch and scale virtual servers as needed. It offers various instance types and the ability to customize the operating system and software packages installed on the virtual servers. EC2 is pay-as-you-go, with users only paying for the resources they use while the virtual servers are running.

S3 : Amazon S3 is a cloud storage service that offers scalable, high-durability storage for data. It is designed to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web, and is commonly used by businesses of all sizes. S3 is pay-as-you-go, with no upfront fees or long-term commitments, and offers a range of storage classes for different data storage scenarios.

Lambda : Amazon Lambda is a serverless computing service that allows you to run code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources. It is pay-as-you-go, with no upfront costs or long-term commitments, and enables you to build and run event-driven applications and services without the need to worry about infrastructure.
It'as a FaaS : Function as a Service (FaaS) is a cloud computing model in which a provider allows users to run their own code in the cloud without worrying about infrastructure or maintenance. FaaS is cost-effective and convenient, abstracting away the underlying infrastructure and handling all deployment tasks. It is particularly useful for applications with variable or bursty workloads.

SNS : Amazon SNS is a fully managed messaging service that allows you to send messages to multiple subscribers or other applications. It is pay-as-you-go and can be used to send notifications, alerts, and other types of messages to email, SMS, and other channels.

SQS : Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that allows you to decouple and scale microservices and applications. It offers standard and FIFO queues and is pay-as-you-go with no upfront costs or long-term commitments. SQS is reliable and scalable, making it easy to build and run highly available, fault-tolerant applications.

CloudWatch : 
Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service for AWS resources and applications that provides data and operational insights, allows you to set alarms, and enables you to visualize, search, and analyze logs. It is pay-as-you-go with no upfront costs or long-term commitments.
